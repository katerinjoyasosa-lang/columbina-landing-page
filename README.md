- Columbina – Character Bio Landing Page

    Responsive landing page inspired by Columbina from Genshin Impact.
    The goal was to translate her serene and spiritual essence into a clean, immersive digital bio using only HTML and CSS.


- Concept

The design preserves the visual identity of the game while emphasizing tranquility through:

    * Soft, cool color palette

    * Clear typographic hierarchy

    * Balanced composition and spacing

The focus was emotional atmosphere, not just information display.


- Mobile Strategy

    Designed to be fully responsive.
    The mobile version allows users to access character information from their phone without leaving the game on desktop.


- Process

    The project started with a Figma prototype to define layout, hierarchy, and visual direction before development.
